More specifically, functions are compiled just before getting executed. A more suitable description of the Julia compilation model might, therefore, be Just-Ahead-of-Time (JAOT) compilation. The term JIT is sometimes used to describe the compilation model where code is dynamically recompiled based on runtime performance data, which Julia does not do. At the same time, Julia comes with a lot of built-in functionality including several standard libraries. If all this built-in functionality would need to be parsed, type inferred and compiled every time Julia started, the startup-time would be longer than reasonable. Therefore, Julia bundles something called a \"sysimage\" which is a shared library where (roughly) the state of a running Julia session has been stored (serialized).  When Julia starts, this sysimage gets loaded, which is a quite quick process (50ms on the author's machine), and all the cached compiled code can immediately be used, without requiring any compilation.","category":"page"},{"location":"devdocs/sysimages_part_1.html#Custom-sysimages","page":"Creating a sysimage","title":"Custom sysimages","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"devdocs/sysimages_part_1.html","page":"Creating a sysimage","title":"Creating a sysimage","text":"There are cases where one wants to generate a custom sysimage for a similar reason as to why Julia bundles one: to reduce time from Julia start until the program is executing. The time from startup to execution is here denoted as \"latency\" and we want to minimize the latency of our program.  A drawback of putting a package inside the sysimage is that it becomes \"frozen\" at the particular version it was, when it got put into the sysimage. In addition, all the dependencies of the package put into the sysimage will be frozen in the same manner.  In particular, it will no longer be updated like normal packages when using the package manager. In some cases, other ways of reducing latency might be preferable, for example, using Revise.jl","category":"page"},{"location":"devdocs/sysimages_part_1.html#Example-workload","page":"Creating a sysimage","title":"Example workload","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"devdocs/sysimages_part_1.html","page":"Creating a sysimage","title":"Creating a sysimage","text":"To have something concrete to work with, let's assume we have a small script that reads a CSV-file and computes some statistics on it.

Firstly, all the modules used in the precompilation statements (like DataFrames) are not defined in the Main namespace. Secondly, due to some bugs in the way Julia export precompile statements running a precompile statement can fail.  The solution to these issues is to load all modules in the sysimage by looping through Base.loaded_modules and to use a try-catch for each precompile statement.

In short, an incremental sysimage is built on top of another sysimage, while a non-incremental is created from scratch. For sysimages, it makes sense to use an incremental sysimage built on top of Julia's default sysimage since we wanted the benefit of having a responsive REPL that it provides.  For apps, this is no longer the case, the sysimage is not meant to be used when working interactively, it only needs to be specialized for the specific app.  Therefore, by default, incremental=false is used for create_app. If, for some reason, one wants an incremental sysimage, incremental=true could be passed to create_app.  With the example app, a non-incremental sysimage is about 70MB smaller than the default sysimage.","category":"page"},{"location":"apps.html#Filtering-stdlibs","page":"Apps","title":"Filtering stdlibs","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"apps.html","page":"Apps","title":"Apps","text":"By default, all standard libraries are included in the sysimage.

The reason this is not the default is that it is possible to \"accidentally\" depend on a standard library without it being reflected in the Project file.  For example, it is possible to call rand() from a package without depending on Random, even though that is where the method is defined. If Random was excluded from the sysimage that call would then error.

Part 3 details how to bundle that executable together with the Julia libraries and other files needed so that the bundle can be sent to and run on a different system where Julia might not be installed.

When you call a function for the first time, Julia compiles it for precisely the types of the arguments given. This can take some time. All subsequent calls within that same session use this fast compiled function, but if you restart Julia you lose all the compiled work.

Typically the goal is to reduce latency on your machine; for example, you could load the packages and compile the functions used in common plotting workflows use that saved image by default. In general, sysimages are not relocatable to other machines; they'll only work on the machine they were created on.\nYou can further compile an entire project into a relocatable \"app\". This generates a bundle of files (including the executable) that can be sent and run on other machines that might not even have Julia installed. Not only does this aim to do as much compilation up-front, but it also bundles together all dependencies (including potentially cross-platform binary libraries) and Julia itself with a single executable as its entry point.\nAlternatively, you can create a C library. In this case, your package should define c-callable functions to be included in the sysimage. As with apps, generating a library bundles together Julia and all dependencies in a (hopefully) redistributable directory structure that can be moved to other machines (of the same architecture).","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The most challenging part in all cases is in determining which methods need to be compiled ahead of time. For example, your project will certainly require addition between integers (+(::Int, ::Int); thankfully that's already compiled into Julia itself), but does it require addition of dates (like +(::Date, ::Day) or +(::DateTime, ::Hour))? What about high-precision complex numbers (+(::Complex{BigFloat}, ::Complex{BigFloat}))?
