    Incrementally compile `package` into the current system image.
    `force = true` will replace the old system image with the new one.
    This process requires a script that julia will run in order to determine
    which functions to compile. A package may define a script called `snoopfile.jl`
    for this purpose. If this file cannot be found the package's test script
    `Package/test/runtests.jl` will be used. `compile_incremental` will search
    for `snoopfile.jl` in the package's root directory and in the folders
    `Package/src` and `Package/snoop`. For a more explicit version of compile_incremental,
    see: `compile_incremental(toml_path::String, snoopfile::String)`

    Not all packages can currently be compiled into the system image. By default,
    `compile_incremental(:Package) will also compile all of Package's dependencies.
    It can still be desirable to compile packages with dependencies that cannot be
    compiled. For this reason `compile_incremental` offers
    the ability for the user to pass a list of blacklisted packages
    that will be ignored during the compilation process. These are passed as a
    vector of package names (defined as either strings or symbols) using the
    `blacklist keyword argument`
