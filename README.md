PackageCompiler is a Julia package with three main purposes:

  1. Creating custom sysimages for reduced latency when working locally with packages that has a high startup time.

  2. Creating "apps" which are a bundle of files including an executable that can be sent and run on other machines without Julia being installed on that machine.

  3. Creating a relocatable C library bundle form of Julia code.

For installation and usage instructions, see the [documentation][docs-stable-url].
