# [Creating a binary from Julia code](@id man-tutorial-binary)

!!! info
    This section is for people who want to understand PackageCompiler.jl under
    the hood. It is not required reading to use the package.

This section targets how to build an executable based on the custom sysimage so
that it can be run without having to explicitly start a Julia session.

## Interacting with Julia through `libjulia`.

The way to interact with Julia without using the Julia executable itself is by
calling into the Julia runtime library (`libjulia`) from a C program.  A quite
detail set of docs for how this is done can be found at the [embedding chapter
in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/embedding/) and it
is recommended to read before reading on.  Since this is supposed to highlight
the internals of PackageCompiler, will not use the conveniences shown in that
section (e.g. the `julia-config.jl` script) but it is good to know they exist.

A rough outline of the steps we will take to create an executable are:

- Create our Julia app with a `Base.@ccallable` entry-point which means the Julia
  function can be called directly from C.
- Create a custom sysimage to reduce latency (this is pretty much just doing
  part 1) and to hold the C-callable function from the first step.
- Write an embedding wrapper in C that loads our custom sysimage, does some
  initialization and calls the entry point in the script.

## A toy application

To have something concrete to work with we will create a very simple
application.  Keeping with the spirit of CSV parsing, we will create a small
app that parses a list of CSV files given as arguments to the app and prints
the size of the parsed result. The code for the app (`MyApp.jl`) is shown
below:

```julia
module MyApp

using CSV

Base.@ccallable function julia_main()::Cint
    try
        real_main()
    catch
        Base.invokelatest(Base.display_error, Base.catch_stack())
        return 1
    end
    return 0
end

function real_main()
    for file in ARGS
        if !isfile(file)
            error("could not find file $file")
        end
        df = CSV.read(file)
        println(file, ": ", size(df, 1), "x", size(df, 2))
    end
end

if abspath(PROGRAM_FILE) == @__FILE__
    real_main()
end

end # module
```

The function `julia_main` has been annotated with `Base.@ccallable` which means
that a function with the unmangled name will appear in the sysimage. This
function is just a small wrapper function that calls out to `real_main` which
does the actual work.  All the code that is executed is put inside a try-catch
block since the error will otherwise happen in the C-code where the backtrace
is not very good

To facilitate testing, we [check if the file was directly
executed](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/faq/#How-do-I-check-if-the-current-file-is-being-run-as-the-main-script?-1)
and in that case, run the main function.  We can test (and time) the script on
the sample CSV file [from the first tutorial](@ref man-tutorial-sysimage)

```
❯ time julia MyApp.jl FL_insurance_sample.csv
FL_insurance_sample.csv: 36634x18
julia MyApp.jl FL_insurance_sample.csv  12.51s user 0.38s system 104% cpu 12.385 total
```

## Create the sysimage

As in the previous tutorial, we do a "sample run" of our app to record what
functions end up getting compiled.  Here, we simply run the app on the sample
CSV file since that should give good "coverage":

```
julia --startup-file=no --trace-compile=app_precompile.jl MyApp.jl "FL_insurance_sample.csv"
```

The `custom_sysimage.jl` script look similar to before with the exception that
we added an include of the app file inside the anonymous module where the
precompilation statements are evaluated in:

```julia
Base.init_depot_path()
Base.init_load_path()

@eval Module() begin
    Base.include(@__MODULE__, "MyApp.jl")
    for (pkgid, mod) in Base.loaded_modules
        if !(pkgid.name in ("Main", "Core", "Base"))
            eval(@__MODULE__, :(const $(Symbol(mod)) = $mod))
        end
    end
    for statement in readlines("app_precompile.jl")
        try
            Base.include_string(@__MODULE__, statement)
        catch
            # See julia issue #28808
            Core.println("failed to compile statement: ", statement)
        end
    end
end # module

empty!(LOAD_PATH)
empty!(DEPOT_PATH)
```

The sysimage is then created as before:

```
❯ julia --startup-file=no -J"/home/kc/julia/lib/julia/sys.so" --output-o sys.o custom_sysimage.jl

❯ gcc -shared -o sys.so -fPIC -Wl,--whole-archive sys.o -Wl,--no-whole-archive -L"/home/kc/julia/lib" -ljulia
```

### Windows-specific flags

For Windows we need to tell the linker to export all symbols via the flag `-Wl,--export-all-symbols`.
Otherwise, the linker will fail to find `julia_main` when we build the executable.

## Creating the executable

### Embedding code

The embedding script is the "driver" of the app. It initializes the julia
runtime, does some other initialization, calls into our `julia_main` and then
does some cleanup when it returns.  We can borrow a lot for this embedding
script from the embedding manual there are however some things we ne
ed to set up
"manually" that Julia usually does by itself when starting Julia.  This
includes assigning the `PROGRAM_FILE` variable as well as updating `Base.ARGS`
to contain the correct values. The script `MyApp.c` ends up looking like:

```c
// Standard headers
#include <string.h>
#include <stdint.h>

// Julia headers (for initialization and gc commands)
#include "uv.h"
#include "julia.h"

JULIA_DEFINE_FAST_TLS()

// Forward declare C prototype of the C entry point in our application
int julia_main();

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    uv_setup_args(argc, argv);

    // JULIAC_PROGRAM_LIBNAME defined on command-line for compilation
    jl_options.image_file = JULIAC_PROGRAM_LIBNAME;
    julia_init(JL_IMAGE_JULIA_HOME);

    // Initialize Core.ARGS with the full argv.
    jl_set_ARGS(argc, argv);

    // Set PROGRAM_FILE to argv[0].
#if JULIA_VERSION_MAJOR == 1 && JULIA_VERSION_MINOR >= 9
    jl_binding_t *bp = jl_get_binding_wr(jl_base_module, jl_symbol("PROGRAM_FILE"), 1);
    jl_checked_assignment(bp, (jl_value_t*)jl_cstr_to_string(argv[0]));
#else
    jl_set_global(jl_base_module, jl_symbol("PROGRAM_FILE"), (jl_value_t*)jl_cstr_to_string(argv[0]));    
#endif

    // Set Base.ARGS to `String[ unsafe_string(argv[i]) for i = 1:argc ]`
    jl_array_t *ARGS = (jl_array_t*)jl_get_global(jl_base_module, jl_symbol("ARGS"));
    jl_array_grow_end(ARGS, argc - 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        jl_value_t *s = (jl_value_t*)jl_cstr_to_string(argv[i]);
        jl_arrayset(ARGS, s, i - 1);
    }

    // call the work function, and get back a value
    int ret = julia_main();

    // Cleanup and gracefully exit
    jl_atexit_hook(ret);
    return ret;
}
```

## Building the executable

We now have all the pieces needed to build the executable; a sysimage and a driver script.
It is compiled as:

```
❯ gcc -DJULIAC_PROGRAM_LIBNAME=\"sys.so\" -o MyApp MyApp.c sys.so -O2 -fPIE \
    -I'/home/kc/julia/include/julia' \
    -L'/home/kc/julia/lib' \
    -ljulia \
    -Wl,-rpath,'/home/kc/julia/lib:$ORIGIN'
```

where we have added an `rpath` entry into the executable so that the julia
library can be found at runtime as well as the `sys.so` library ($ORIGIN means
to look in the same folder as the binary for shared libraries).

```
❯ time ./MyApp FL_insurance_sample.csv
FL_insurance_sample.csv: 36634x18
./MyApp FL_insurance_sample.csv  0.19s user 0.09s system 242% cpu 0.115 total

❯ ./MyApp non_existing.csv
ERROR: could not find file non_existing.csv
Stacktrace:
 [1] error(::String) at ./error.jl:33
 [2] real_main() at /home/kc/MyApp/MyApp.jl:21
 [3] julia_main() at /home/kc/MyApp/MyApp.jl:7
```

### macOS considerations

On macOS, instead of `$ORIGIN` for the `rpath`, use `@executable_path`.

### Windows considerations

On Windows, it is recommended to increase the size of the stack from the
default 1 MB to 8MB which can be done by passing the `-Wl,--stack,8388608`
flag.  Windows doesn't have (at least in an as simple way as Linux and macOS)
the concept of `rpath`.  The goto solution is to either set the `PATH`
environment variable to the Julia `bin` folder or alternatively copy paste all
the libraries in the Julia `bin` folder so they sit next to the executable.
